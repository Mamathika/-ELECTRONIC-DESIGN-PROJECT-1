20EC5203  ELECTRONIC DESIGN PROJECT- I
MODULE 1 - LETTER CARD COUNTER USING LDR 

ABSTRACT:
This project focuses on designing a letter counter system using a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) and associated circuitry. The system detects letters or objects passing through a light path, converts 
the changes in light intensity into electrical signals, and counts these signals using a 4033 decade counter IC. The count is visually displayed on a seven-segment display. The setup includes essential 
components such as a signal conditioning circuit, which ensures reliable signal processing, and a reset button for resetting the count. A 9V power supply drives the entire circuit. This project is a practical 
and cost-effective solution for applications such as document sorting, assembly lines, or educational tools demonstrating electronics concepts. 

INTRODUCTION:
The letter counter project is an innovative application of basic electronic components to create a system that detects and counts objects or letters as they pass through a predefined path. The primary sensing element 
in this project is a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR), which changes its resistance based on the intensity of incident light. By strategically placing the LDR in a light path, any object or letter interrupting the light 
causes a measurable signal change. This signal is then processed and counted using a signal conditioning circuit and a 4033 decade counter IC.The output count is displayed ona seven-segment display, providing a clear 
and user-friendly visual representation. A reset button is incorporated to allow manual resetting of the count to zero,enhancing the usability of the system. The project is powered by a simple 9V battery, making it portable.

OBJECTIVE:
To notify user about urgent letters.
To preserve the condition of the letters.
To modify the existing letter box.

SCOPE:
Making a real time monitoring and remote connected system using GSM. 
The counter can be integrated into smart home systems, enabling users to receive notifications on their smartphones when a letter is detected
